        "contentPreview": "<p>Ken Grant\u2019s <em>Cwm: A Fair Country</em>, a collection of nearly 30 years of landscape photography in the South Walian valleys, begins with a moving prologue. It mentions a painting he\u2019s known since his Liverpudlian childhood, still sitting above his 92-year-old father\u2019s mantelpiece: \u201cDapple-bruised Welsh horses, painted in a loose herd, are imagined beneath a sky that promises rain.\u201d</p> <p>From 1998, on commutes from Liverpool to the University of Wales, Newport (where he led a documentary photography degree), he noticed similar horses \u2013 completely by coincidence. \u201cI didn\u2019t seek them out at first, but on my drives, I soon got aware that they were there. Sometimes up a valley\u2019s road, you\u2019d see packs of 40 or 50.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re rewarded by staying with subjects over time, seeing any kinds of changes or shifts, slow dismantlings or initiations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some were descendants of animals on"

        "contentPreview": "<p>As the land of the free and the home of the brave reverberates to cries of Make America Great Again, what is often overlooked is the complicated notion of the word \u201cagain\u201d. As highlighted in American Photography, an expansive, sometimes beautiful but often shocking survey at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam over the past two centuries, what has been great for some has been downright awful for others.</p>    <p>\u201cAmerica and photography are entwined. You can\u2019t see the two apart from each other,\u201d says Mattie Boom, curator of photographs at the Rijksmuseum, who has spent two decades helping build the American collection. It now amounts to around 7,000 photographs \u2013 all by American photographers of American subjects \u2013 and 1,500 American photobooks and magazines. The current exhibition is the first major survey of the field to be staged in Europe, and is a triumphant swansong for Boom as she retires from her post.</p> <p>There is no hierarchy to the selection.

Hague, an abstract sculptor working mainly in wood, was a friend and mentor to Frank, whose 1958 coast to coast journey, <em>The Americans</em>, had been a landmark in documentary photography. The picture is included in Graham\u2019s new book, <em>Goin\u2019 Down the Road </em><em>With Robert Frank</em>, about the photographer. Frank <a href=\"xhttps://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/11/robert-frank-the-americans-outsider-genius-photography\">died in 2019 aged 94</a>.</p> <p>Graham\u2019s memoir is a personal homage to Frank\u2019s influence and an intimate pictorial history of his later years. Graham met the older photographer in the late 1970s when he had spent a couple of years working on oil rigs and was looking for a change of life. Frank bought him a camera and some film and subsequently worked with him for a decade \u201cin and out of the darkro"
